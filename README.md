# Finalproject

For my project I created a version of the classic snake game.  The snake must navigate the game board to eat food while avoiding randomly placed obstacles and the borders.  I used a linked list data structure to construct the snake that is present in the game board.  
A linked list is a list of nodes that contain two elements, a data value or in this case a location on the game board and a pointer to the next node in the list.  This provided an accessible way to keep track of the snake head and future body parts that are added as food is consumed in the game.

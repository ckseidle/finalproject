# finalproject

For my project I created a version of the classic snake game.  I used a linked list data structure to construct the snake.  A linked list is a list of nodes containing data as well as a pointer leading to the next node in the list.  This provided an accessible way to keep track of the snake head and future body parts that are added as food is consumed in the game.
